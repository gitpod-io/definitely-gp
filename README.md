# External Gitpod Configuration

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) is an online IDE for GitHub.
This repository contains externally maintained `.gitpod` files for projects on GitHub.

The files are organized by repository name. If you need a different configuration for a fork the repository folder can contain a folder for the organisation.

The configuration format is explained [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configuration/).

PRs are very welcome! :heart:
